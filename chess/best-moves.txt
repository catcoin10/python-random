These are the best moves as discovered by my program after going after some tries.

Here they are:

a3 - 50.7%
b3 - 50.0%
c3 - 49.3%

I'm sorry, but I didn't put black because I don't have that much time. That feature is coming soon (maybe). However, that is probably not necessary because you might (not 100% sure) be able to invert this by doing the opposite side if you get black.

Even though there are over 9 million possibilities according to https://www.chess.com/forum/view/fun-with-chess/how-many-possible-chess-moves-can-there-be-in-a-chess-game, I decided to give this a hand. The computer has tried 4,000 games at the rate of 35 games per minute per thread. Here are the moves:

['Nc3', 'f3', 'd4']2017/4000
['Nc3', 'f3', 'd3']2037/4000
['Nc3', 'f3', 'Ne1']1971/4000
['Nc3', 'f3', 'Ne4']2000/4000

['c3', 'e4', 'Be2']25807/51120
['c3', 'e4', 'Qe2']25781/51190
['c3', 'e4', 'Ke2']25285/50220

These games need a lot more work because the #s vary by very small margins. We need to test the numbers, and it looks like we have a margin of error of 2.5% with a 95% confidence level and 1.18% at a 75% confidence level.

So, this is not the best program for testing the best chess combo, but it still works well enough to get an idea... |:

Note: that face is a neutral face because I used it to give myself an advantage while playing chess. Do NOT get complacent, the advantage by the tips is small if it exists, which it probably does!
