Chess simulation program and module

This is a program I pieced together to try to calculate the best opening moves in chess. Unfortunately, I can't calculate that much (because [of] the computational resources, and that's probably a good thing if you're my opponent), but I tried it out and it did give me a bit of an edge. I am planning to keep on calculating moves at the 3 move level (that is the highest level that isn't completely hopeless) and try to figure out what the best combo is.
